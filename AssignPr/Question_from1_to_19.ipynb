    "#Q:- What is an interpreted language & dynamically typed language? Write 5 differnce between them.\n",
    "#Ans:\n",
    "'''Interpreted Language:\n",
    "An interpreted language is a type of programming language where most of its implementations execute instructions directly, without the need for prior compilation into machine-language instructions. In an interpreted language, the code is executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime, which means the program can be run directly from the source code. This allows for easier debugging and platform independence, as the same code can run on any system with the appropriate interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamically Typed Language:\n",
    "A dynamically typed language is a language in which variables do not have a fixed type and can be reassigned to different types during execution. In such languages, type checking is performed at runtime as opposed to compile-time. This provides flexibility, as variables can change types, but it may also lead to runtime type errors if types are not managed carefully.'''\n",
    "\n",
    "#pyhton is Interpreted and Dynamicallly typed languge\n",

    "#Eg:-\n",
    "# Interpreted Language Example\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}\")\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\")  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Dynamically Typed Language Example\n",

    "1.Definition:\n",
    "Interpreted Language: Refers to the method of execution, where code is executed line by line by an interpreter.\n",
    "Dynamically Typed Language: Refers to how the language handles variable types, allowing them to be determined at runtime.\n",

    "2.Execution:\n",
    "Interpreted Language: Code is executed directly by an interpreter. There is no need for prior compilation.\n",
    "Dynamically Typed Language: Variables can change types dynamically during program execution. The type is checked during runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Performance:\n",
    "Interpreted Language: Generally slower execution compared to compiled languages because each instruction is parsed and executed on the fly.\n",
    "Dynamically Typed Language: Performance can vary; type checking at runtime can introduce overhead, but it allows for more flexible and quicker coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Flexibility:\n",
    "Interpreted Language: Platform-independent code, as the interpreter can run the same code on different platforms.\n",
    "Dynamically Typed Language: Variables can hold any type of data at different times, providing flexibility but requiring careful management to avoid type errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Debugging and Development:\n",
    "Interpreted Language: Easier debugging and immediate execution make it suitable for scripting and rapid development.\n",
    "Dynamically Typed Language: Simplified variable declarations and flexibility in variable usage, but potential for runtime errors if types are not managed correctly.'''\n"
