<<<<Deploying a Flask Application Using Gunicorn and Nginx>>>>
<To deploy a Flask application to a production server using Gunicorn and Nginx, follow these steps:

1. Install Gunicorn
>>>Gunicorn (Green Unicorn) is a WSGI HTTP server for running Python web applications. It acts as an intermediary between your Flask application and Nginx.

--installation:
#pip install gunicorn

2. Install Nginx
>>>Nginx is a web server that can also function as a reverse proxy. It handles incoming HTTP requests and forwards them to Gunicorn.

--installation:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx

3. Configure Gunicorn
>>>Create a Gunicorn configuration or use command-line arguments to specify how to run your Flask application.

--Basic Command to Run Gunicorn:
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app

Where:-
>>'-w 4': Specifies the number of worker processes (adjust as needed).
>>'-b 0.0.0.0:8000': Binds Gunicorn to port 8000.
>>>'app:app': Refers to the Flask application instance (app) in the app.py file

4. Configure Nginx
>>>Create an Nginx configuration file to set up Nginx as a reverse proxy for Gunicorn.

5. Verify Deployment
>>Check if Gunicorn is Running:
Ensure Gunicorn is running with the correct command and binding to the specified port.

>>Check Nginx Configuration:
Verify that Nginx is properly forwarding requests to Gunicorn by accessing your domain or IP
