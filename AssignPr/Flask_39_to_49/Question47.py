#Question 47.Describe the steps to create a Flask blueprint and why you might use one.

#Answer:-
''' 
A Flask blueprint is a way to organize your Flask application into smaller, reusable components.
Blueprints allow you to break down your application into modules, making it easier to manage and maintain. 
They are especially useful for large applications or when you want to reuse code across multiple projects.

<<<Steps to Create a Flask Blueprint>>>
1.Install Flask: Ensure you have Flask installed in your environment.
2.Create a Blueprint: Define a blueprint in a separate Python file.
3.Register the Blueprint: Register the blueprint with the main Flask application.
4.Use the Blueprint: Define routes and views within the blueprint

<<<Why Use Blueprints?>>>
1.Modularity: Blueprints allow you to organize your application into smaller, manageable modules.
2.Reusability: You can reuse blueprints across multiple projects.
3.Separation of Concerns: Blueprints help separate different parts of your application, making it easier to maintain and understand.
4.Collaboration: Blueprints make it easier for multiple developers to work on different parts of the application simultaneously.
